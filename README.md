## ‚ú® Overview

This project is an experimental physics-based particle simulator written entirely in Rust.
It leverages **Macroquad** for cross-platform rendering and aims to provide a clean, extensible codebase for experimenting with particle systems, gravity, collisions, and fluid-like behavior.

The long-term goal is to **port it to the web** via `wasm32` for interactive browser-based simulations while keeping full control over the UI layer (HTML/CSS-based).
